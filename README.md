AI Chatbot System

Project Summary

The AI Chatbot System is designed to handle customer queries, provide support, and interact with users in natural language. It leverages machine learning algorithms and predefined knowledge to understand and respond to user queries. The system also includes tools for conversation management, interaction data analysis, and continuous improvement of response accuracy.
